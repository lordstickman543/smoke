<p><b>NOT AFFILIATED WITH VALVE OR STEAMWORKS</b></p>
the repository for my game launcher<br>
i might open source it once dev finishes if anybody is interested for some reason<br>
it uses an api to grab releases and install them<br>
if you want to publish a game on the launcher email me at lordstickman543@gmail.com<br>
<p>the launcher will be free to download when the development finishes<br>the games must be published for no charge</p>
